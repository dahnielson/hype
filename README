Installation
------------

After unpacking or checking out the sourcetree:

1) Install the third-party libraries 'adodb_lite', 'Compat' and 'Smarty' 
   in the 'vendor' directory.

2) Rename 'config/database-example.php' to 'database.php' and edit 
   the settings.

3) Optionaly, rename 'config/ftpsync-example.cfg' to 'ftpsync.cfg' 
   and edit the settings.


Directory structure
-------------------

app
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.

app/controllers
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblog_controller.php
  for automated URL mapping. 

app/models
  Holds models that should be named like post.php.

app/views
  Holds template files for the view that should be named like
  weblog/index.php for the $WeblogController->index() action. 

app/helpers
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblog_helper.php

app/apis
  Hold API classes for web services.

config
  Holds the config files.

lib
  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code
  that doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This
  directory is in the include path. 

public
  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories
  for images, stylesheets and javascripts.

tests
  Holds all the unit tests.

vendor
  External libraries that the application depends on. This directory is 
  in the include path.


Models
------

The models use the adodb_lite interface of the global 'database' object 
to access the SQL database. Of course models can use other datasources,
like remote calls to other webservices (with api implementations placed 
in 'app/apis'), or anything else (with implementations placed in 'lib').


Views
-----

Views are implemented as Smarty template files with additional template 
tags.

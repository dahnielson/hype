README for Hype


Design Requirement
------------------

Hype was design with a set of requirements in mind:

* Must run on PHP4 (>=4.4.2)
* Must run in Safe Mode
* Can not rely on PEAR

The primary reason for them are the limitation my current host impose 
on the project.


Third-party libraries
---------------------

To use Hype you need to install a couple of third-party libraries in the
'vendor/' directory. They are:

* adodb_lite (from http://adodblite.sourceforge.net)
* Compat (from http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Compat)
* Smarty (from http://smarty.php.net)


Coding Standard
---------------

Options can be stored and passed around in two different formats:

$params

  Params are options formated as query strings, they're build with the 
  build_params() function from associative arrays and parsed back into arrays
  with the parse_params() function.

$args

  Args are options formated as associative arrays.
